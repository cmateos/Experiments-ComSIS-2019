This folder contains the directory structure and necessary files to run and measure micro-benchmark performance.
First, a Caliper-ready micro-benchmark (both a lighter and a heavy version) should be placed under the "src" folder. 
Micro-benchmarks should be compiled by running ./compile.sh (please make sure Java is installed).

To measure micro-benchmark performance: 
- Open a terminal in this folder
- Run:
	"sudo ./runClass.sh caliper.stringConcatenation.ECaliper_StringBuilder" o
	"sudo ./runClass.sh caliper.stringConcatenation.ECaliper_StringConcatenation"

The script will generate a log in this folder with the following columns:

- Voltage[V]
- Current[A]
- Active power[W]
- Apparent power[VA]
- Power factor
- Energy[KWh]

The source code of the software (implemented in C) to talk to the Power Meter equipment is also provided (pmRead.cpp). 
It has been compiled using gcc into a.out for convenience purposes.
